use by FreeRTOS+FAT.  FreeRTOS+FAT will use two consecutive indexes from this

file name support.

potentially exist around the use of long file names in FAT file systems
before enabling long file name support. */

Set to 1 to include a file's short name when listing a directory, i.e. when

Set to 0 to only include a file's long name. */

"SETUP.exe" in a short-name entry.  This is the recommended setting for
maximum compatibility.

Set to 0 to ignore the case bits. */

slower, but making changes faster. */

FreeRTOS_time has the same semantics as the standard time() function. */

Set to 0 if the media is not removable.

When set to 1 all file handles will be "invalidated" if the media is
extracted.  If set to 0 then file handles will not be invalidated.

Set to 0 to exclude the ff_fprintf() function.

ff_fprintf() is quite a heavy function because it allocates RAM and
brings in a lot of string and variable argument handling code.  If
ff_fprintf() is not being used then the code size can be reduced by setting
ffconfigFPRINTF_SUPPORT to 0. */

FAT type. */
